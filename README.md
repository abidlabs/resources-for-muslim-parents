## 🗓️ Before your baby is born

Read:
* **[Children Around the Prophet](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Around-Prophet-Muhammad-Companions/dp/1986793443)**: Very insightful look at how the Prophet (S) treated  children, written from a psychological / children's development perspective

Watch:
* **[Parenting Matters](https://online.alkauthar.org/courses/parenting-matters/)**: a short light-hearted set of videos that covers the Islamic duties of a parent as well as useful tips for raising children

Buy:
* [3-in-1 Baby Stroller with Car Seat](https://www.target.com/p/graco-modes-pramette-travel-system-with-snugride-infant-car-seat-britton/-/A-77407532#lnk=sametab): the fact that the car seat detaches from the stroller and attaches to the base is almost a necessity!

*Tip*: it's never too early to start praying for your child. In this du'a, we ask for a united family unit that has a good influence on others: *Rabbanaa hab lanaa min azwaajina wa zurriyaatina qurrata a'yun. Waj'alnaa lil muttaqeena imaamaa.* Our Lord! Grant unto us spouses and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the righteous.

* [Montessori from the Start: The Child at Home, from Birth to Age Three](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805211128/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_G3FBH49K3WDSAJE0AZY2): contains both a theoretical section on the principles of Montessori as well as practical tips on how to apply it to your child

Buy:
* [Magnetic Onesies](https://magneticme.com/): the easiest way to dress your baby, easier than zip-on onesies and far easier than button-on clothing

*Tip*: These first few months are tough. Lack of sleep and physical effort may cause you or your spouse to become irritable. Be patient with each other, and know that it does get easier, inshaallah.
