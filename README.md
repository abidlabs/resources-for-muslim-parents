*Tip*: it's never too early to start praying for your child. In this du'a, we ask for a united family unit that has a good influence on others: *Rabbanaa hab lanaa min azwaajina wa zurriyaatina qurrata a'yun. Waj'alnaa lil muttaqeena imaamaa.* Our Lord! Grant unto us spouses and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the righteous.
